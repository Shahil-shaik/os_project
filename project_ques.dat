13. Design a scheduling program to implements a Queue with two levels:
Level 1 : Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling
Level 2 : Round Robin Scheduling
For a Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling (Queue 1), the Priority 0 is highest priority. If
one process P1 is scheduled and running , another process P2 with higher priority comes.
The New process (high priority) process P2 preempts currently running process P1 and
process P1 will go to second level queue. Time for which process will strictly execute
must be considered in the multiples of 2..
All the processes in second level queue will complete their execution according to
roundrobin scheduling.
Consider: 1. Queue 2 will be processed after Queue 1 becomes empty.
2. Priority of Queue 2 has lower priority than in Queue 1.



20. CPU schedules N processes which arrive at different time intervals and each process is
allocated the CPU for a specific user input time unit, processes are scheduled using a
preemptive round robin scheduling algorithm. Each process must be assigned a numerical
priority, with a higher number indicating a higher relative priority. In addition to the
processes one task has priority 0. The length of a time quantum is T units, where T is the
custom time considered as time quantum for processing. If a process is preempted by a
higher priority process, the preempted process is placed at the end of the queue. Design a
scheduler so that the task with priority 0 does not starve for resources and gets the CPU at
some time unit to execute. Also compute waiting time, turn around.
